# `convert_annotations_genes`: Convert gene annotations from any keys to any keys

## Description

Convert gene annotations from any keys to any keys

## Usage

```r
convert_annotations_genes(genes, from_what, to_what, OrgDB)
```

## Arguments

* `genes`: gene vector
* `from_what`: input type (like "SYMBOL","ENTREZID","ENSEMBL","GENENAME",...), keys should be supported by AnnotationDbi. Search for the help page of AnnotationDbi for further help.
* `to_what`: output type (like "SYMBOL","ENTREZID","ENSEMBL","GENENAME",...), keys should be supported by AnnotationDbi. Search for the help page of AnnotationDbi for further help. Can be multiple items E.g. `c("ENTREZID","ENSEMBL","GENENAME")`
* `OrgDB`: human = org.Hs.eg.db, mouse = org.Mm.eg.db, search BioConductor website for further help

## Value

a data.frame

# `database_from_gmt`: parse GMT files file to a data.frame

## Description

Read `.gmt` files. You can download them from https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/collections.jsp
WikiPathway database also provides pre-built GMT files (https://data.wikipathways.org/current/gmt/). In default they are recorded as ENTREZ IDs, so you need to provide proper species database (e.g. org.Hs.eg.db for human), to database_from_gmt function and EnrichGT will automatically convert ENTREZ IDs to gene symbols for enrichment analysis.

## Usage

```r
database_from_gmt(gmtfile, OrgDB = NULL, convert_2_symbols = T)
```

## Arguments

* `gmtfile`: gmt file path
* `OrgDB`: Only need when converting genes, human = org.Hs.eg.db, mouse = org.Mm.eg.db, search BioConductor website for further help. Default is NULL.
* `convert_2_symbols`: Force to convert numeric gene ids (as ENTREZIDs) to gene symbols

## Description

See `?EnrichGT()`

## Usage

```r
egt_compare_groups(
  obj.test,
  obj.ctrl,
  name.test = NULL,
  name.ctrl = NULL,
  ClusterNum = 15,
  P.adj = 0.05,
  force = F,
  nTop = 10,
  method = "ward.D2",
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

* `obj.test`: the enriched object from tested group. WARNING: `obj.test` and `obj.ctrl` should come from same database (e.g. GO Biological Process(GOBP)).
* `obj.ctrl`: the enriched object from control group. WARNING: `obj.test` and `obj.ctrl` should come from same database (e.g. GO Biological Process(GOBP)).
* `name.test`: optional, the name of the testing group. If is `NULL`, the object name of `obj.test` will be used.

* `ClusterNum`: how many cluster will be clustered
* `P.adj`: p.adjust cut-off. To avoid slow visualization, you can make stricter p-cut off.
* `force`: ignore all auto-self-checks, which is useful
* `nTop`: keep n top items according to p-adj in each cluster.
* `method`: the agglomeration method to be used. This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of) one of "ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average" (= UPGMA), "mcquitty" (= WPGMA), "median" (= WPGMC) or "centroid" (= UPGMC).

The `List` contains objects with overlapped enriched terms, unique enrich terms.

# `egt_enrichment_analysis`: A C++ accelerated universal enrichment analyzer (Over-Representation Analysis (ORA))

## Description

ORA is a statistical method used to identify biological pathways or gene sets that are significantly enriched in a given list of genes (e.g., differentially expressed genes). The method compares the proportion of genes in the target list that belong to a specific category (e.g., pathways, GO terms) to the expected proportion in the background gene set.
To accelerate the computation in ORA analysis, `EnrichGT` have implemented a function that leverages C++ for high-performance computation. The core algorithm utilizes hash tables for efficient lookup and counting of genes across categories. Also It provides multi-Core parallel calculation by package `parallel`.

## Usage

```r
res <- egt_enrichment_analysis(genes = DEGtable$Genes,
database = database_GO_BP())

res <- egt_enrichment_analysis(genes = c("TP53","CD169","CD68","CD163",...),
database = database_GO_ALL())

res <- egt_enrichment_analysis(genes = c("TP53","CD169","CD68","CD163",...),
database = database_from_gmt("MsigDB_Hallmark.gmt"))

res <- egt_enrichment_analysis(list(Macrophages=c("CD169","CD68","CD163"),
Fibroblast=c("COL1A2","COL1A3"),...),
 database = database_from_gmt("panglaoDB.gmt"))
```

## Arguments

* `genes`: a vector of gene ids like `c("TP53","CD169","CD68","CD163"...)`.If you have genes from multiple source or experiment group, you can also pass a list with gene ids in it. For Example , `list(Macrophages=c("CD169","CD68","CD163"),Fibroblast=c("COL1A2","COL1A3))`.The genes should be match in the second param `database`'s `gene` column. For example, if database provides Ensembl IDs, you should input Ensembl IDs. But in default databases provided by `EnrichGT` is gene symbols.
* `database`: a database data frame, can contain 3 columns (ID, Pathway_Name, Genes) or just 2 columns (Pathway_Name, Genes). You can read a data frame and pass it through this or run `database_GO_CC()` to get them, see example.You can run `database_GO_CC()` to see an example.The ID column is not necessary. EnrichGT contains several databases, functions about databases are named starts with `database_...`, like `database_GO_BP()` or `database_Reactome()`.The default gene in each database EnrichGT provided to input is `GENE SYMBOL` (like TP53, not 1256 or ENSG...), not `ENTREZ ID` or `Ensembl ID`.It will be more convince for new users. Avaliable databases includes `database_GO_BP()`, `database_GO_CC()`, `database_GO_MF()` and `database_Reactome()`.You can add more database by downloading MsigDB (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/collections.jsp)'s GMT files. It can be load by using `database_from_gmt(FILE_PATH)`.If you only have simple a table, you can also pass a data frame through this arguement. Of note, it should contains at least 2 coloumn (colnames(df) = c("Terms","Genes)), the first is term names and the second are the corresponding genes. If you have term ids, you can add a `ID` column at the first column, and `Terms` becomes the second column and `Genes` the third.
* `p_adj_methods`: one of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none"
* `p_val_cut_off`: adjusted pvalue cutoff on enrichment tests to report
* `background_genes`: background genes. If missing, the all genes listed in the database
* `min_geneset_size`: minimal size of genes annotated for testing
* `max_geneset_size`: maximal size of genes annotated for testing
* `multi_cores`: multi_cores (Experimental), only used when analysis a list of genes (multi-source or groups). Set to 0 or 1 to disable. May use lots of RAM.

# `egt_gsea_analysis`: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) by EnrichGT

## Description

A warpper of `fgsea::fgsea()`.
GSEA is a computational method used to determine whether predefined gene sets (e.g., pathways, GO terms) are statistically enriched in a ranked list of genes. Unlike ORA, GSEA considers the entire gene list and focuses on the cumulative distribution of gene ranks to identify coordinated changes.
The fgsea (https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea) package is an R tool that implements an accelerated version of GSEA. It uses precomputed statistical methods and efficient algorithms to dramatically speed up enrichment analysis, especially for large datasets.

## Usage

```r
res <- egt_gsea_analysis(genes = genes_with_weights(genes = DEG$genes, weights = DEG$log2FoldChange),
database = database_GO_BP())

res <- egt_gsea_analysis(genes = genes_with_weights(genes = PCA_res$genes,weights =PCA_res$PC1_loading),
database = database_from_gmt("MsigDB_Hallmark.gmt"))
```

## Arguments

* `genes`: a named numeric vector, for example c(`TP53`=1.2,`KRT15`=1.1,`IL1B`=1.0,`PMP22` = 0.5,`FABP1` = -0.9, `GLUT1` = -2).The number is the weight of each gene, can use the logFC form DEG analysis results instead. Also NMF or PCA's loading can also be used.`EnrichGT` provides a `genes_with_weights(genes,weights)` function to build this numeric vector. Importantly, this vector should be !SORTED! for larger to smaller.
* `database`: a database data frame, can contain 3 columns (ID, Pathway_Name, Genes) or just 2 columns (Pathway_Name, Genes). You can read a data frame and pass it through this or run `database_GO_CC()` to get them, see example.The ID column is not necessary. EnrichGT contains several databases, functions about databases are named starts with `database_...`, like `database_GO_BP()` or `database_Reactome()`.The default gene in each database EnrichGT provided to input is `GENE SYMBOL` (like TP53, not 1256 or ENSG...), not `ENTREZ ID` or `Ensembl ID`. It will be more convince for new users.Avaliable databases includes `database_GO_BP()`, `database_GO_CC()`, `database_GO_MF()` and `database_Reactome()`.You can add more database by downloading MsigDB (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/collections.jsp)'s GMT files. It can be load by using `database_from_gmt(FILE_PATH)`.If you only have simple a table, you can also pass a data frame through this arguement. Of note, it should contains at least 2 coloumn (colnames(df) = c("Terms","Genes)), the first is term names and the second are the corresponding genes. If you have term ids, you can add a `ID` column at the first column, and `Terms` becomes the second column and `Genes` the third.
* `p_val_cut_off`: adjusted pvalue cutoff on enrichment tests to report
* `min_geneset_size`: minimal size of genes annotated for testing
* `max_geneset_size`: maximal size of genes annotated for testing
* `gseaParam`: other param passing to fgsea
* `p_adj_methods`: one of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none"

## Value

a `compareCluster` result from `clusterProfiler`

# `egt_plot_results`: Visualize enrichment results using simple plot

## Description

This plot is the most widely like `enrichplot::dotplot()`used method to visualize enriched terms. It shows the enrichment scores (e.g. p values) and gene ratio or NES as dot size and color / or bar height. Users can specify the number of terms using `ntop` or selected terms to color via the `low.col` and `hi.col`.

## Usage

```r
egt_plot_results(x, ntop = 30, ..., P.adj = NULL)
```

## Arguments

* `x`: a data frame form enriched result like `egt_enrichment_analysis()` or `egt_gsea_analysis()`, or an re-clustered `EnrichGT` object
* `ntop`: Show top N in each cluster
* `...`: Other param
* `P.adj`: If pass an origin data.frame from original enriched result, you can specify the P-adjust value cut off. If is null, default is 0.05. When passing `EnrichGT_obj`, this filter is previously done by `egt_recluster_analysis`.
* `low.col`: the color for the lowest
* `hi.col`: the color for the highest
* `max_len_descript`: the label format length, default as 40.

# `egt_plot_umap`: Visualize results generated form `EnrichGT()` using UMAP

## Description

A word frequency matrix represents the frequency of words or tokens across different documents or text samples. Each row corresponds to a document, and each column represents a word or token, with the cell values indicating the frequency of the respective word in that document.However, high-dimensional data like word frequency matrices can be challenging to interpret directly. To make such data easier to analyze, we can reduce its dimensionality and visualize the patterns or clusters in a 2D or 3D space. UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a powerful, non-linear dimensionality reduction technique widely used for this purpose.

## Usage

```r
egt_plot_umap(x, ...)
```

## Arguments

* `x`: an EnrichGT object
* `...`: Other param

# `egt_recluster_analysis`: Parse enrichment results and further clustering and visualizing

## Description

Cluster enrichment results based on hit genes for ORA (e.g, typical GO enrichment) or core enrichment from GSEA using term frequency analysis. This provides a clearer view of biological relevance by focusing on the genes that matter most.
Gene enrichment analysis can often be misleading due to the redundancy within gene set databases and the limitations of most enrichment tools. Many tools, by default, only display a few top results and fail to filter out redundancy. This can result in both biological misinterpretation and valuable information being overlooked.
For instance, high expression of certain immune genes can cause many immune-related gene sets to appear overrepresented. However, a closer look often reveals that these gene sets are derived from the same group of genes, which might represent only a small fraction. Less than 1/10 of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). What about the other 9/10?  Do they hold no biological significance?
The main purpose of developing this package is to provide a lightweight and practical solution to the problems mentioned above.

## Usage

```r
egt_recluster_analysis(
  x,
  ClusterNum = 17,
  P.adj = 0.05,
  force = F,
  nTop = 10,
  method = "ward.D2",
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

* `x`: an enrichment result from `clusterProfiler`, or a `data.frame` containing result from `clusterProfier`. To perform fusing multi-database enrichment results, please give a `list` object.
* `ClusterNum`: how many cluster will be clustered
* `P.adj`: p.adjust cut-off. To avoid slow visualization, you can make stricter p-cut off.
* `force`: ignore all auto-self-checks, which is useful
* `nTop`: keep n top items according to p-adj in each cluster.
* `method`: the agglomeration method to be used. This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of) one of "ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average" (= UPGMA), "mcquitty" (= WPGMA), "median" (= WPGMC) or "centroid" (= UPGMC).
* `...`: Others options.

## Details

For an ORA result, c("ID","Description","GeneRatio","pvalue","p.adjust","geneID","Count") should be contained;
 For GSEA, c("ID","Description","NES","pvalue","p.adjust","core_enrichment") should be contain.
 For `compareClusterResult`, a `compareClusterResult` object or a data-frame with additional `Cluster` column should be contained, others similar to ORA result.
 To perform fusing multi-database enrichment results, please give a `list` object.
