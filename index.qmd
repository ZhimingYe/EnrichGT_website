### Highlights

| EnrichGT means [enrich]{.underline}ing previously enriched results ($E^2_{\text{enrich}}$) into [g]{.underline}reat [t]{.underline}ables and more ... |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Efficient C++-based functions for **rapid enrichment** analysis |
| **Simple** input format, empowering non-pro users |
| Re-clustering of enriched results provides **clear and actionable insights** |
| User-friendly **HTML output** that is easy to read and interpret |
| **AI (LLM)** based result annotation |
| Do a series of things just in **ONE** package |

### Aim and Scope

Please note that the primary goal of `EnrichGT` is to provide researchers in wet labs, who have been busy all day, with quick and insightful biological interpretations from dry lab data to support their experiments. Therefore, all computational methods employed are relatively straightforward and pragmatic. For example, `C++` based ORA enrichment function, GSEA only using `fgsea` output without more analysis, use only vocabulary frequency matrix for re-enrichment instead of term's similarity, and more... Its purpose is to offer a “quick overview”. After this initial overview, you can use more widely recognized tools to generate statistically rigorous results (not necessary though). However, don’t misunderstand—this does not mean that the statistical processes in `EnrichGT` are incorrect. I’ve made every effort to ensure their accuracy; they are just less refined. Additionally, the tool has been tested in most typical scenarios, but extreme cases cannot be entirely ruled out.

This package was developed under the inspiration of *clusterProfiler* (a wonderful and powerful package! I have learned a lot. Without it I won't develop `EnrichGT`.), but none of `EnrichGT`'s internal functions rely on any *clusterProfiler* functions. Some database-loading code references *clusterProfiler*‘s implementation, but it has been extensively modified to provide lightweight experience. In other words, this is not a case of rebranding *clusterProfiler* under a different name. It’s a lightweight implementation designed to wet-labs. If you need a tool that handles every detail, please use *clusterProfiler* instead. Please see [acknowledgment](acknowledgement.qmd) page for citing *clusterProfiler*.

# Install EnrichGT

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("ZhimingYe/EnrichGT")
```

The `AnnotationDbi`, `fgsea`, `reactome.db` and `GO.db` were from BioConductor and might be slow to install. If you can't install, please re-check your web connections or update your R and BioConductor, or use [Posit Package Manager](https://packagemanager.posit.co/) to install when using old R.

# Meet EnrichGT

Please see articles on the left! Especially the [basic workflow](basic.qmd) introduction.

See [package function page](pkgfuns.html) for further detail params of functions. (For example, how to use a function)

You can use `? function` to get further help when installed.

``` r
?egt_recluster_analysis
```
:::

In most examples of this document, we use a result table of DEG analysis `DEG.csv`. The gene symbols of `DEG.csv` is on the first column without column name. In default `read_csv()` convert the unamed column name to `...1`. So `DEGtable$...1` refers to gene symbols.
